git clone "your_github_url"
cd "your_method"
```

1. Prepare feature files

Some details of where the dataset is found or how the dataset will be generated

### Training and Inference
We give examples on how to perform training and inference with "your_method".


1. "your_method" training

The general training command is:
```
bash scripts/train.sh
```

To train our "your_method" model on "dataset":
```
bash scripts/train.sh anet
```

2. "your_github_url" test

The general test command is:
```
bash scripts/test.sh
```

The results should be comparable with the results we present at Table "number" of the paper. 
E.g., "your_results".
